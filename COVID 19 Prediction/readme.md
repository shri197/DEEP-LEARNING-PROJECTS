**COVID 19 Prediction**

This project is based on dataset containing Normal X-ray and Pneumonia X-ray images and Building a model to predict whether the X-ray is normal or pneumonial(Covid X-ray).

1. Keras and tensorflow used for designing the model<br />
2. OpenCV for image processing<br />
3. ImageDataGenerator for augmenting images<br />
4. Building model using Convolutional Neural Network
